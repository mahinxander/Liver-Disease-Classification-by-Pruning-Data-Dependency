## Liver Disease Classification by Pruning Data Dependency Utilizing Ensemble Learning Based Feature Selection

This repository is the implementation of [Liver Disease Classification by Pruning Data Dependency Utilizing Ensemble Learning Based Feature Selection](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-22695-3_43) for the [AI 2022: Advances in Artificial Intelligence](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-22695-3) that was presented in 35th Australasian Joint Conference, AI 2022, Perth, WA, Australia.

## Overview
 Liver disease is responsible for over 2 million additional deaths globally each year. Therefore, early detection and treatment may lower the likelihood of liver disease-related death. This study suggests a methodology that integrates approaches for classifying liver disease by reduction of data dependency, which gives the advantage of getting more accurate predictions even with less data. Moreover, Two imputation strategies were employed to tackle missing value and were contrasted with each other. Despite showing slight differences, no statistically significant distinctions between them were found. Machine Learning (ML) methods such as Random Forest, Extra Trees, Support Vector Machine, and K-Nearest Neighbor and neural network such as Multilayer Perceptron were employed to categorize liver diseases.
